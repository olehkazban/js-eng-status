##2019-February-13

* *Theory*
	* Investigated information about type conversion, conditionals and loops

* *Practise*
	* Working with data types, conditionals and loops. (https://github.com/daniildeli/JStrainings/tree/master/JS/type_condition_loops)
	
*  There are a few moments that seems a little weird for me:
	* Type conversion: 
		* {} + [] + {} + [1] ==> "[object Object][object Object]1";
		* ! + [] + [] + ![] ==> "truefalse";
		* {} + [] ==> "[object Object]";	 
		* +{} + [] ==> "NaN";  
	* for of: Can we use it for objects like:
		let obj = {
		  a: 1,
		  b: 2,
		  c: 3
		}
		
		for (let i of obj){
		  console.log(i);
		}

		==> TypeError
